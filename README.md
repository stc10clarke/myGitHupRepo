For all who know me, which is not a lot, I am very happy now, I was not happy for a long time. I discovered that happiness lies in the path, not in the destination.
I have learn to make my daily tasks more meaningful now that I understand they are not a means to an end, but intrinsilicly a part of myself.
The road we travel in life is measured by the changes to ourselves.
