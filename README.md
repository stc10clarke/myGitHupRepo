For all who know me, which is not a lot, I am very happy now. I was not happy for a long time. I discovered that happiness lies in the path not the destination.
I have learn to make my daily tasks more meaningful now that I understand them not to be a means to an end, but intrinsilicly a part of myself.
The real road in life we travel is through the changes to ourselfs
